admin must start game:  button on control panel



board is fixed number of sections partitioned into cells (squares, hexes, etc) by non-zero-size boundaries
	each cell and boundary is an object
		positioned in game coordinates
		scale factor maps game coordinates to canvas coordinates
	boundary extends one width past edge of cell
	line of sight: two triangles; find cells/boundaries with vertices in both triangles; check if each contains sight-blocking object
		wrap-around must be done as warps
		click to move:  if line-of-sight
		drop attack power on player:  attack can check line-of-sight

objects in a cell
	player
	treasure, key, fire, trap, large stone, etc, etc
objects on a cell boundary
	wall, door, fire, portal (for wrapping)

player
	stats
		movement: 1, action: 1, hit points: 1, max pool items: 1
	move to adjacent cell
		check if boundary allows it
		decrement movement
	pick up/use/drop object; use power
		can modify any stat
	modifier: drop on stat or power (no undo), increments power pool-count
	turn finished when action goes to zero or player presses Done
	trade powers/modifiers/objects
power
	stats
		pool-count:1
	counteraction: chance to defend against attack
object
	stats
		pool-count:1
	pick-up: if implemented, then drop is also allowed, even if not implemented
	throw: if implemented

wizwar
	intrinsic action:  1 hit point attack

	user hit points: 15
	user movement: 3
	only one modifier per power or stat, per turn
