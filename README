Game engine built on NodeJS that supports a diverse class of games
including TicTacToe, Monopoly, WizWar, and miniatures war gaming.

The engine is turn-based.  Each player starts with a basic set of abilities
and objects and obtains additional abilities, modifiers, and objects from a
pool.  The player's stats, abilities, modifiers, objects, pool behavior,
non-player characters, and victory conditions are all defined via
configuration and JavaScript code snippets.

The engine does not provide any chat capabilities.  Instant Messaging
clients already provide all the necessary functionality.  Access to IM
clients also makes it hopeless to restrict in-game communication, no matter
how interesting it would be for game balance, so the engine does not try to
foster any illusions.
