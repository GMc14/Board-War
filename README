Game engine built on NodeJS that supports a class of games which includes
WizWar.

The engine is turn-based.  Each player starts with a basic  set of
abilities and objects and obtains additional abilities, modifiers, and
objects from a pool.  The player's stats, abilities, modifiers, objects,
pool behavior, non-player characters, and victory conditions are all
defined via configuration and JavaScript code snippets.
