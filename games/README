Each directory contains the configuration for a game.

"board" contains the configuration of the game board.  The file format is:

  type (square)
  size (width x height)
  %%
  custom rendering code

"game" defines general game options as key:value pairs.

"player" defines player options as key:value pairs.

"style.css" defines custom styles to apply in views/boardwar.ejs

All files in the img sub-directory are automatically loaded into
game_config.images as a map of file names to base64-encoded data: uri's.
This map is sent to each client via <img> tags embedded in the page.  The
id of each <img> tag is the name of the file.  This allows the client to
render the images on the game canvas.  (Note that the image type is
determined from the file suffix, not the file contents!)
